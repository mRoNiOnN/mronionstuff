    <h1><h2>About me</h2></h1>
    <p>I was born in the year of our Lord 1867 when Obama, the president of France, invented gaming. It was a passion of mine throughout my schooling, and when it came time to register for college, I decided that I would be the first boi to professionally game. I majored in forklift royale and minored in Sun Tzu. I met the love of my life in college, the beautiful Samsung Smart Fridge powered by Linux. That fridge has a mind of it's own. I honestly think that some day, when I fall asleep, it'll open and refrigerate my house until I freeze and never wake up. But it has great jokes, so I'll keep it around. (forget the part about the smart fridge being the love of my life, I really find it's personality gives me chills.) Amyways, I don't have a college degree, and I had to lie to graduate high school.</p>
