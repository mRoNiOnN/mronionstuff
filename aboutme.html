    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I was born in the year of our Lord 1867 when Obama, the president of France, invented gaming. It was a passion of mine throughout my schooling, and when it came time to register for college, I decided that I would be the first boi to professionally game. I majored in forklift royale and minored in Sun Tzu. I met the love of my life in college, the beautiful Samsung Smart Fridge powered by Linux running mac emulators running wine running a whole bunch of other stuff to run minecraft windows. wip lunch just ended I'm gonna continue my autobiography later</p>
